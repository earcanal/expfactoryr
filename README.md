### Build
To build the container locally:

docker build -t expfactory/expfactoryr . 
```

## Usage

To use the container, you should mount your experiment package directory to
`/data`. For example, if we have an experiment testing folder called "stroopr"
in our present working directory, we would run:

```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/stroopr:/data expfactory/expfactoryr test
```

And the package would be installed, and tested per:

```
devtools::install_deps(dependencies=TRUE)
devtools::check()
devtools::test()
```
