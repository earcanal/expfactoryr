# expfactoryr

R package for processing data generated by [The Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/).

## Installation

```
library(devtools)
install_github('expfactory/expfactoryr')
```

## Docker

### Build
To build the container locally:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t vanessa/expfactory-r . 
```

### Usage

To use the container, you should mount your experiment package directory to
`/code`. For example, if we have an experiment testing folder called "stroopr"
in our present working directory, we would run:

```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/stroopr:/data expfactory/expfactoryr test
```

And the package would be installed, and tested per:

```
devtools::install_deps(dependencies=TRUE)
devtools::check()
devtools::test()
```
